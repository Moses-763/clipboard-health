This project contains two challenges - a "Ticket Breakdown" challenge and a "Refactoring" challenge. The two challenges are unrelated, but you should complete both in the same folder and share the link in Coderbyte. Any written answers should be included in markdown files within this folder.


## [Ticket Breakdown](Ticket_Breakdown.md) Solution
1. Ticket breakdown file was created (ticket-breakdown.js);
2. getShiftByFacility function was created to fetch shifts by facilityId
3. generateReports function was also created for generating reports;
4. Json data was generated for representing Shifts, Agents and Facility database
5. Unit testing was written (ticket-breakdown.test.js) for testing getShiftsByFacilityId and generateReports.
6. Run yarn test to run test
7. Run yarn start to getShiftsByFacilityId and generateReports
8. The report generated file is report.pdf
9. [Generated Reports](https://github.com/Moses-763/clipboard-health/blob/main/report.pdf)


## [Refactoring](Refactoring.md)

If you are a JS novice, here's how to get started:
1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (we use `^16`, the latest LTS)
2. Run `npm i` in this repo to install dependencies
3. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests
4. Run `npm start` to launch `index.js` for any manual testing
